      <description>Abstract: Illite plays a critical role in diagenetic processes of sedimentary rocks, influencing geochemical evolution, reservoir quality, and fluid flow pathways. This study experimentally investigated the hydrothermal transformation of kaolinite to illite using sandstones from the Upper Ordovician Quwarah Member of Qasim Formation, northwest Saudi Arabia. Experiments were performed to simulate burial diagenesis involving illitization using three fluid systems: a synthetic solution (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2), natural Red Sea water, and modified Red Sea water (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2 + Red Sea water) at different temperatures (80 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C). Analysis included thin-section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, whereas the elemental compositions of the experimental solutions were analyzed using ICP-MS and Ion Chromatography. At 80 °C and 150 °C, kaolinite underwent dissolution without significant mineralogical changes. At 200 °C, continued kaolinite disaggregation and dissolution produced smectite and mixed smectite–chlorite/illite layers, indicating early transformation pathways. At 250 °C, fluid chemistry exerted strong control on clay minerals. The synthetic solution formed smectite with minor chlorite and illite; Red Sea water favored well developed smectite; the modified Red Sea water promoted well-developed illite due to increased potassium availability. The experiments show illitization is strongly temperature dependent and primarily…&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Organic-rich shale facies of the Lower Jurassic Datta Formation in the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan was studied using geological and geochemical investigation for assessment the unconventional oil shale reservoir potential. The Datta shale facies is a promising oil-prone stratum, consisting of total organic carbon (TOC) exceeding 2 wt.%, and primarily comprising Type II and II/III kerogens, with a hydrogen index (HI) exceeding 250 mg HC/g TOC. The Datta shale facies is also characterized by higher free hydrocarbon (S 1 ) than TOC, resulting in a high oil saturation index (OSI) between 30.81 mg HC/g TOC and 298.7 mg HC/g TOC, wherein the high OSI of more than 100 mg HC/g TOC indicates a strong potential for oil production. This finding consistent with the current thermally mature of oil window, ranging between early-mature and peak-mature, as supported by vitrinite reflectance (%VRo) values of up to 0.82. This main oil generation window leads to convert extensive of the hydrogen-rich kerogen for commercial oil generation, with a transformation ratio (TR) of up to 65%, as demonstrated in the 1-D basin modeling. The maximum oil generation, with TR values exceeding 50%, leads to high pressure and results in micro-fracture pores in the Datta shale facies. The presence of the non-fabric fracture pores is confirmed by the high-resolution petrographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Consequently, these findings highlight that the Datta shale facies is considered for use as an unco…&#10;Venue: Petroleum Geoscience&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Oil and gas fields in subsidence-prone regions face multiple hazards that threaten the resilience of their infrastructure. This study presents an integrated risk mapping framework for the Yibal field in the Sultanate of Oman, utilizing remote sensing and geophysical data. Multi-temporal PS-InSAR analysis from 2010 to 2023 revealed cumulative surface deformation and tilt anomalies. Micro-seismic and fault proximity data assessed subsurface stress, while a flood risk map-based surface deformation-adjusted elevation captured hydrological susceptibility. All datasets were standardized into five risk zones (ranging from very low to very high) and combined through a weighted overlay analysis, with an emphasis on surface deformation and micro seismic factors. The resulting risk map highlights a central corridor of high vulnerability where subsidence, seismic activity, and drainage pathways converge, overlapping critical infrastructure. The results demonstrate that integrating geomechanical and hydrological factors yields a more accurate assessment of infrastructure risk than single-hazard approaches. This framework is adaptable to other petroleum fields, enhancing infrastructure protection (e.g., pipelines, flowlines, wells, and other oil and gas facilities), and supporting sustainable field management.&#10;Venue: Earth&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Constraining past topography and the shape of Earth’s surface is the next frontier in palaeogeography and full-plate tectonic modelling. Mountains are highly dynamic on geological time scales, growing in response to tectonic processes such as subduction and continent collision, and eroding as they are exposed to precipitation and time. Mountain ranges regulate atmospheric circulation and enforce a first order control on dissolved river loads and the transport of sediments to sedimentary basins. Because of this, mountains and the changing elevation of Earth’s surface are essential to understanding how the wider Earth system has evolved through time. Here we present a computational full-Earth, forward model of palaeotopography and palaeobathymetry from 1 Ga to present-day. We use an existing full- plate tectonic model, which traces the evolution of tectonic plate boundaries, to automatically isolate specific tectonic environments that are associated with mountain building, such as continental arcs, continental collisions, rifts and large igneous provinces. Our model separates Earth’s continental surface into a set of equally spaced nodes, so that each node can record its own unique topographic evolution, independent of the nodes around it. Once these regions have been identified, we simulate their growth, and decay, over the last 1 Ga, using parameters and limits derived from the present-day expression of topography on Earth. Our model produces a set of maps at 1° resolution an…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: ABSTRACT Organic‐rich shale facies of the Lower Cretaceous Sembar Formation in the Lower Indus Basin, southern Pakistan, was studied to assess the original organic matter (OM) input and depositional environment, and to anticipate the impact of thermal maturity levels on the thermogenic gas formation from oil‐to‐gas conversion. The Sembar shales exhibit high total organic carbon (TOC) and sulphur concentrations, with TOC/S ratios exceeding 1 in dominant samples, suggesting deposition under low‐oxygenated marine environmental conditions. The organic carbon enrichment in Sembar shale facies is attributed to low‐oxygen depositional settings combined with extended intervals of warm‐water conditions. Molecular biomarker evidence such as abundant tricyclic terpanes, and a higher proportion of C 27 regular steranes relative to their C 28 and C 29 homologues indicates that the OM within the Sembar shale facies is predominantly sourced from marine algae and bacteria, with minor terrigenous land plant input. This high abundance of aquatic organisms in Sembar shale facies indicates that hydrogen‐rich Types II and II/III kerogen were the original OM input during deposition. This finding contradicts the current measured low hydrogen index (HI) values, between 2 mg HC/g TOC and 138 mg HC/g TOC, indicative of predominantly Types III and IV kerogen in the studied exploration wells. This drastic alteration of the original hydrogen‐rich OM is interpreted as thermal overprinting, wherein the hyd…&#10;Venue: Geological Journal&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Urbanization and climate change are intensifying the co-occurrence of drought and surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects, yet their combined dynamics remain poorly understood at high spatial resolution. This study evaluates the compound risk of drought and UHI in South Korea&apos;s Saemangeum region using a hybrid KNN–LSTM model, alongside three comparative approaches (KNN, CNN, CNN–LSTM), incorporating CMIP6 climate projections and satellite-derived land metrics. The KNN–LSTM model demonstrated superior performance (R² = 0.94; MSE = 0.0053), accurately capturing an increasing drought–SUHI association, which rose from 0.84 (1991–2020) to 1.00 by 2100 under the SSP585 scenario. High-risk zones predominantly overlap with built-up and cropland areas, where UHI indices exceed 4.0 and drought probabilities surpass 0.9. Although land use explains over 80% of drought variability under baseline conditions, its predictive power diminishes under future warming, highlighting the growing role of climate feedbacks. These findings emphasize the emergence of synchronized thermal and hydrological stressors in urbanizing coastal regions and underscore the need for integrated land-climate adaptation strategies supported by machine learning-based early warning systems.&#10;Venue: Geocarto International&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Knowledge about environmental change and the evolutionary history of hominins in Arabia has been rapidly developing over the last two decades. Interdisciplinary research on humans and environments across the vast and heterogenous landmass of the Arabian Peninsula remains, however, highly spatially uneven. Here we present the results of archaeological, hydro-geological, and palaeontological research in inland northeastern Arabia, a poorly studied area with diverse landscape features including caves, palaeorivers, and chert outcrops. Hominin use of the landscape appears to be sparse in comparison to other regions of Arabia, though archaeological evidence spanning from the Lower Palaeolithic to the historic era was identified, including finds from the Middle Palaeolithic, which is the most well represented period. The caves of inland northeast Arabia contain a rich record of past climate change in the form of speleothems, as well as abundant faunal assemblages. Our survey results highlight the significant potential of these records to cast light on environmental, faunal, and cultural changes over time while demonstrating regional variation across Arabia.&#10;Venue: PLoS ONE&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Luminescence dating of interdune sabkha sediments and cross strata deposited on the lee face of a 160-m-high mega-crescentic dune in the eastern Rub’ al-Khali sand sea provides information on dune dynamics and preservation potential. Optically stimulated luminescence ages show that the rates of dune accumulation varied during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene. Sedimentary structures indicate that megadune migration was the result of strong northwesterly “Shamal” winds. During the same interval of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, linear dunes in the northeastern United Arab Emirates were also accumulating rapidly, indicating that the period 16−9 ka was characterized by regionally widespread dune formation and/or reworking. The dune has subsequently migrated to the SSE almost 900 m since the early Holocene, at an average rate of 77 m/k.y., indicating persistence of the Shamal wind system for at least 20 k.y. Rates of megadune migration and wet sabkha accumulation reveal that, despite their very large size, less than 1% of the megadune would be preserved in a sedimentary record.&#10;Venue: Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: ABSTRACT The Lower Cretaceous Yamama Formation of southern Iraq represents a key carbonate reservoir within Iraq and the Middle East, yet its complex depositional facies architecture and diagenetic alterations present challenges for predicting reservoir quality. This study integrates well‐log interpretation, detailed description of about 400 m of core intervals, petrographic analysis, fluid‐inclusion microthermometry, and stable‐isotope (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) geochemistry from several oilfields to determine the controls on reservoir heterogeneity. Fourteen depositional facies are recognized across a W–E‐trending, slightly steepening homoclinal ramp. These vary into four reservoir (YRA–YRD) and four nonreservoir (B0–B3) units. Reservoir intervals consist mainly of shoal grain‐supported peloids and ooids and Lithocodium–Bacinella reefal facies, whereas mud‐supported lagoonal and middle‐ramp facies form permeability barriers. Diagenetic processes exerted strong control on reservoir quality evolution. Early marine rim and scattered calcite cements preserved interparticle pores in the grain‐supported limestone facies, whereas burial equant calcite sourced by stylolitization of the host limestones reduced porosity. The precipitation of pore‐filling kaolin and saponite in the mud‐supported limestone facies limited porosity. Saponite is suggested to have been formed from alkaline brines developed under restricted, evaporative conditions. The formation of kaolin is attributed to the migrati…&#10;Venue: Journal of Petroleum Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: &lt;title&gt;Abstract&lt;/title&gt; To maximize the utilization of Mg-rich natural resources for CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal (CDR), an integrated strategy has been proposed that focuses on synthesizing reactive CDR materials aimed at both climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability. This study demonstrates the use of lizardite-rich natural feedstock, an abundant and accessible resource, combined with industrial marble waste. Through thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, this mixture yields a reactive CDR material primarily composed of forsterite and lime. Carbonation experiments of the synthesized material show complete transformation of lime into calcite and substantial weathering of forsterite into hydrated and carbonated secondary minerals. Compared to the Ca₂SiO₄ + MgO system, the synthesized material exhibits higher eco-efficiency with comparable CO₂ sequestration, storing ~ 21% as CaCO₃ and ~ 6% as MgCO₃ in 30 days versus ~ 25% and ~ 5% over 7 weeks (Chen and Kanan 2025), while promoting sustainable industrial waste valorization. Additionally, forsterite is more suitable for ocean alkalinity enhancement applications, whereas Ca₂SiO₄ is better aligned with use in the cement industry. Taken together, we propose that our material has strong potential for large-scale deployment in ex-situ carbon mineralization, ocean alkalinity enhancement, soil amendment, industrial point-source capture, and in-situ geological carbonation. This potential depends on developing sustaina…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Flood hazards in arid oil-producing regions are significantly influenced by both natural hydrological processes and terrain changes resulting from subsidence. This study develops a deformation-adjusted approach to flood risk assessment for the Yibal field in the northern part of the Sultanate of Oman, where long-term hydrocarbon production has led to measurable ground deformation. A high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from an aerial survey in 2013 was adjusted using cumulative surface deformation data (2013–2023) derived from PS-InSAR measurements. By subtracting the surface deformation from the baseline DEM, an updated DEM for 2023 was produced that explicitly incorporates subsidence into hydrological modeling. Weighted flood risk mapping was then performed using slope, precipitation, land use/land cover, and drainage parameters. Results show a marked increase of flood vulnerability, with high- to very high-risk zones (8.0-8.6, 8.7-9.6) expanding in areas affected by surface deformation. These findings demonstrate that conventional flood risk mapping, which neglects subsidence, can underestimate hazard levels in petroleum fields where ground deformation alters drainage pathways. Incorporating subsidence-adjusted terrain data into hydrological risk assessment provides more realistic flood susceptibility maps, improving early warning, infrastructure protection, and sustainable petroleum field management. Beyond the Yibal field, the method is transferable to other pet…&#10;Venue: Preprints.org&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The uppermost 2 meters of the Maastrichtian Scaglia Rossa Fm. (Gubbio, Italy) record a notable change in the proportions of morphogroups of deep-water agglutinated foraminifera beginning about 1.4 m below the boundary, where we observe a gradual decrease in the abundance of the morphotype M4 (infauna) and a concurrent increase in the morphotype M1 (suspension feeders). This trend suggests a reduction in the flux of organic matter to the sea floor began approximately 114 k.y. before the boundary event. The abundance of M4 shows an abrupt decline from around 13% below the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, to a minimum of 7% in the beds directly above the boundary. This trend suggests a modest, but temporary reduction in organic matter flux to the sea floor following the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary event, though not in the category of a “Strangelove Ocean”. Morphotype M1 shows a marked decrease across the boundary, with values decreasing from &amp;gt;70% to around 11%. The lower Paleocene displays strong fluctuations in the M4 morphogroup. In the same interval we observe a rise in Morphotype M2 (epifaunal detritivores) from values below 10% in the Maastrichtian to over 50% in the basal Paleocene, and a short-lived maximum in Morphotype M3, indicating a decline in particulate organic matter input from suspension and a concurrent increase in bacterial-derived organic matter in the early recovery phase of the Paleocene.

      <description>Abstract: Groundwater level predictive monitoring is necessary to address accelerated aquifer depletion and ensure sustainable management under increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures. This study uses machine learning approaches to model groundwater level (GWL) dynamics in six observation wells in the Ruataniwha Basin, New Zealand. These models are enhanced with seasonal decomposition techniques. This study uses both static properties and dynamic variables to capture hydrogeological heterogeneity. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), with seasonal decomposition preprocessing, were developed for GWL modelling. The models were trained on 80% of the dataset and tested using the remaining 20% of the data. Model accuracy was assessed using five statistical metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Model uncertainty was analyzed using Bayesian Model Averaging combined with the p-factor and d-factor at the 95% confidence level. The results demonstrate that both models delivered strong predictive performance across training, testing, and full period evaluations. However, the RF model demonstrated a marginally superior predictive accuracy by achieving lower errors (MAE: 0.013–0.174; RMSE: 0.04–0.283), better bias control (PBIAS ≈ 0%), and slightly tighter error bounds in most wells.

      <description>Abstract: Core-based data provide critical insights into subsurface reservoir characterization by offering direct observations of rock formations, including lithology, sedimentary structures, and minerals. However, core analysis is frequently compromised by missing intervals resulting from extraction damage, handling losses, and the common practice of drilling inch-size plugs for laboratory analysis. These gaps create significant interpretation challenges, particularly in heterogeneous formations where spatial continuity is essential for accurate reservoir modeling. Given the high operational costs and strategic value of core data, developing reliable methods for reconstructing missing core sections represents a crucial advancement in reservoir evaluation. This study investigates the application of Stable Diffusion Model (SDM) for core interval/plug reconstruction, building on its proven success in conditioned image inpainting tasks. Through systematic evaluation across diverse depositional environments, we demonstrate SDM&apos;s effectiveness in reconstructing homogeneous intervals and gradual facies transition zones, while testing its limitations in handling complex heterogeneous zones with abrupt facies changes. The model shows strengths in restoring sedimentary textures and bedding architectures but faces challenges in accurately predicting the locations of sharp facies boundaries. Our approach enhances the utility of incomplete core images, and the findings along with the proposed pote…&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study reports a well-developed columnar joint set in organic-rich carbonate source rocks, exhibiting distinct vertical prismatic columns with hexagonal to polygonal cross sections. These columnar joints are found within the Upper Cretaceous Muwaqqar Chalk Marl (MCM) Formation, in central Jordan. While columnar joints are commonly observed in igneous rocks, their occurrence in carbonate mudrocks is unique and has rarely been documented in stratigraphic records. This study aims to characterize the geometry and petrographic features of columnar joints observed in organic-rich carbonate source rocks and investigate the mineralogical and geochemical alterations associated with their development. Thorough petrographic and geochemical investigations were carried out to better understand the characteristics, paleoenvironmental context, and associated processes that controlled the formation of these honeycomb-shaped mudrocks. Our findings suggest that the observed columnar joints resulted from subsurface thermal alteration due to the endogenous combustion of the organic-rich carbonate source rocks. This combustion process has led to the development of joints oriented perpendicular to the bedding planes, extending throughout a 2-m-thick interval. These joints slightly taper downward while preserving their polygonal pattern, with column diameter decreasing from 3 to 1 cm. The development of columnar joints within the study interval is primarily attributed to volume contraction resu…&#10;Venue: ACS Omega&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and errors. Previously, we devised an &quot;enriched&quot; chart review protocol where a &quot;roadmap&quot; of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians&apos; original roadmap from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients, we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more, missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap. Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing EHR data with similar accuracy…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The Eocene epoch is known for its fluctuations in climate patterns and the dominance of global greenhouse climate. The Rashrashiyah Formation represents the middle to upper Eocene (biozones E13–E14) marine deposits of claystone to limestone in Saudi Arabia and contains well- to poorly-preserved planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Four different genera were selected for isotopic analysis (Acarinina spp., Subbotina spp., Cibicidoides spp., and Uvigerina spp.). Foraminiferal calcite was used to define the depth of habitat for each genus and mode of life. Four equations were used to infer palaeotemperatures from foraminiferal calcite; three equations are applicable for estimation of sea-surface temperatures (SST) from planktonic foraminifera data, while the fourth equation is applicable estimation of bottom-water temperatures using benthic foraminifera data. The mean SST derived from Acarinina spp. is ~38°C, while the mean bottom water temperature based on Uvigerina spp. is 26°C. Palaeotemperatures derived from this study are notably higher than those reported from this area in the existing literature. This discrepancy may be due to the unique palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic conditions prevalent in the study area. The stable isotope curve is used to infer the transition between the Bartonian and Priabonian and the general cooling trend during this period.&#10;Venue: Geological Quarterly&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 13% and remains a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. PDAC dense stroma hinders drug delivery and reduces treatment efficacy. Calcipotriol (Cal), a known stromal modulator, may enhance drug delivery. This study evaluated the combination of Cal and paclitaxel (PTX) in a polymeric micelle formulation (M-Cal/PTX) to improve drug distribution and efficacy in a PDAC mouse model. Methods: Cal and PTX were encapsulated in a 1:3 ratio in a polymeric micelle (Size: 40-50 nm, Polydispersity index:⁓0.2). In vitro: Nile Red incorporated into the polymeric micelle was used to image the cellular uptake in Kras* Cells on confocal microscopy. In vivo: Using an orthotopic Kras* PDAC mouse model, we assessed the antitumor effect of M-Cal/PTX. Mice were divided and randomized into three groups: M-Cal/PTX (1.8 mg/kg-5.5 mg/kg) (n=7), Abraxane (8 mg/kg) (n=6), and vehicle (sham polymeric micelle) (n=6). Doses were administered intravenously (11 doses)/intraperitoneally (4 doses), five days per week for three weeks, and all surviving animals were sacrificed after the fourth week. Tumors were harvested at the end of the study, weighed, and compared. Results: Sectional imaging from confocal microscopy showed a cytoplasmic uptake of the micelles in Kras* cells within 5 minutes of incubation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed median survival times of ∼14–15 days for vehicle, ∼21.5 days for Abraxane…&#10;Venue: Cancer Research&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Dolomite formation remains a debated topic in sedimentary geology, particularly concerning the mechanisms driving its precipitation under natural conditions. While microbial processes have been well studied, the influence of abiotic factors, such as clay minerals, is less understood. This study uses hydrothermal reactor experiments at 80–250 °C to examine the role of clay minerals in post-compactional dolomitization. Results show that smectite and illite effectively promote dolomitization by providing nucleation sites and aiding Mg2+ dehydration through their highly negative surface charges. In contrast, kaolinite and dickite were less effective due to their charge neutrality. In calcite-kaolinite mixtures, dolomite formed at 200 °C when kaolinite partially converted to smectite but was inhibited at 250 °C due to dickite formation. Samples containing only calcite showed little to no dolomite formation, highlighting the role of reactive clays. Dolomitization occurred through two mechanisms: (1) complete calcite dissolution followed by dolomite nucleation, and (2) recrystallization with progressive Mg incorporation. These findings support clay-catalyzed dolomitization as a significant abiotic pathway in ancient muddy carbonates and mixed clastic-carbonate systems.&#10;Venue: Geology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: A bstract The Eocene Epoch is characterised by multiple hyperthermals, which promoted extensive carbonate sediment deposition and dolomitisation, particularly across the Arabian Plate. The Dammam Formation, a key Eocene aquifer and hydrocarbon‐bearing unit in the Arabian platform, is extensively dolomitised. Several models have been proposed to explain its dolomitisation, many of which invoke sea water or its derivatives as the dolomitising fluid. However, the specific sea water‐driven mechanisms remain poorly understood. More broadly, the effectiveness of commonly used diagenetic proxies (e.g. stable isotopes, stoichiometry and trace elements) in distinguishing between closely related sea water‐driven dolomitisation processes has not been systematically assessed. This study addresses these issues by integrating petrographic, mineralogical, chemical and stable isotopic (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) analyses of a shallow subsurface core from the Dammam Formation. Two distinct dolomite types were identified: Type I (TI), predominantly subhedral and Type II (TII), exhibiting euhedral and subhedral textures. Both types are pervasive, fabric non‐selective and non‐mimetic. The dolomite pre‐dates all other diagenetic processes, such as the formation of palygorskite, calcite, pyrite and stylolite, indicating early, shallow emplacement. Mineralogical data reveal that TI dolomite is near‐stoichiometric (51.4 mol%CaCO 3 ), and well‐ordered, while TII is non‐stoichiometric (56.3 mol%CaCO 3 ) and p…&#10;Venue: The Depositional Record&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Carbonate diagenesis is one of the key processes that ultimately controls reservoir quality and storage capacity of carbonate reservoirs. The rates of early marine diagenetic reactions in the geological past are little constrained. Fundamental physical experiments allow the calibration of early carbonate diagenesis for a variety of further applications, e.g., process-based modeling, fluid-flow and ultimately, reservoir and storage simulation. We conducted a year-long flume tank experiment to study cementation along a supratidal to subtidal depositional profile, with the aim of improving our understanding of early marine cementation. The experiment used artificial sea water with periodic oscillation in water level to create supratidal, intertidal and subtidal diagenetic environments. To simulate an active deposition zone in the subtidal environment, we established a &quot;subtidal zone with deposition&quot; by periodically adding thin layers of carbonate sediment on a monthly basis. Monthly sampling was conducted, with four samples collected to characterize the distinct depositional environments. Furthermore, a quantitative diagenetic model was developed to predict the cementation process within the tank, which was calibrated using experimental water chemistry data. This integrated approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the depositional and diagenetic processes occurring in the simulated subtidal environment.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The global transition to a low-carbon energy future has ignited interest in hydrogen as a clean and versatile energy carrier. NW Saudi Arabia contains vast tracts of mantle-dominated Neoproterozoic ophiolites overlain by a sedimentary cover in the north, NE and east. Our research explores the untapped potential of Saudi Arabia’s ophiolite serpentinites as a possible source of hydrogen generation through serpentinization and related processes. H2 is commonly derived from serpentinization, which primarily involves the hydration of minerals rich in iron and magnesium (e.g., olivine), resulting in the formation of serpentine and H2. Serpentinites are formed by reaction between hydrothermal fluids and mantle rocks, and hydrogen and methane are released in extreme reducing conditions. Under strongly reducing conditions, the formation of magnetite generates hydrogen during serpentinization, following reactions such as: 3Fe2SiO4 + 2H2O = 2Fe3O4 +3SiO2 +2H2. We have conducted a comprehensive assessment of serpentinites in the Arabian Shield, employing the Geographic Information System (GIS) to locate Arabian ophiolites with the largest ultramafic segments. Ophiolites studied include Jabal Ess, Jabal Wask, Bi’r Tululah, and Jabal Tharwah. After ophiolite identification, we delineated fractures and measured fracture density to provide insight into the potential of serpentinite fractures on the amount of possible hydrogen seepage, or natural accumulation in case of an overlying …&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Saudi Arabia, located on the Arabian tectonic plate, is a promising area for exploring sites for natural hydrogen production and accumulation due to the broad existence of ophiolitic ultramafic rocks, especially serpentinites. These rocks, recognized as accreted forearc fragments, are exposed in the western and northwestern segments of the Precambrian Arabian Shield. The present study aims to model the geometry and depth of two ophiolitic suites in NW Saudi Arabia by analyzing airborne magnetic data. The airborne magnetic data were analyzed using edge-detection algorithms (magnetic field derivatives) to study the distribution of lineaments corresponding to rock contacts and tectonic structures, and a lineament density map was produced. The magnetic susceptibility of rock samples collected during field surveys in the broader study area was measured in the lab. The measured values were used as constraints for the 3D inversion of the magnetic data. A 3D geophysical model was constructed and used to determine the tectonic regime of the subsurface in relation to the distribution of the ophiolitic bodies. The lineament map presented the distribution of the tectonic structures, while the lineament density map indicated highly fractured areas. These areas are suitable for the infiltration of rainwater, which creates aquifers into the ophiolitic bodies. These highly fractured areas could serve as water carriers for serpentinization processes at suitable temperatures and provi…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract While CO2 mineralization is a crucial area of research for climate change mitigation, the potential of Saudi Arabian scoriaceous basalts has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to assess these unique basalts as a potential CO2 sink by conducting a longer aging study and, paving the way for Saudi Arabia and regions with similar geological formations to actively contribute to carbon sequestration and emission reduction, supporting sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Climate Action. Scoriaceous basalts were sourced from the Harrat Uwayrid volcanic field in western Saudi Arabia. To simulate CO2 mineralization conditions, these samples were aged in a brine-CO2 environment at 50°C and 1450 psi over three months. Advanced imaging techniques, including micro-CT and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were employed to evaluate the mineralization potential and structural alterations within the basalt. Pre- and post-aging assessments provided detailed insights into the mineralization process occurring within the basalt groundmass, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the changes induced by CO2 exposure. The Micro-CT analysis showed a significant increase in porosity for the scoriaceous basalt sample after three months in a brine-CO2 environment, with porosity rising from an initial 5.72% to 14.89%. Furthermore, it showed that precipitation occurred along the sites of dissolution.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Our study demonstrates the application of seismic sequence stratigraphy interpretation in carbonate-anhydrite dominated interval from sabkha to inner ramp depositional setting. The primary objective is to reconstruct regional stratigraphic architecture including the lateral and vertical distribution of the Arab, Hith, and Asab Formation across the Abu Dhabi area. The regional seismic transects were utilized to perform chronostratigraphy correlation of several wells in the Arab and Hith Formation as well as the equivalent Asab Formation across UAE. Finally, integration with the wellbore data describes reservoir quality and hydrocarbon distribution that have potential for stratigraphic and/or diagenetic traps. A comprehensive and regional approach utilizing various subsurface data including 2D seismic reflection profiles, and wellbore data are presented. Integrated seismic facies analysis, seismic instantaneous attribute, and seismic density inversion, as well as sequence stratigraphy combined with detail petrographic analysis have been applied to reconstruct regional stratigraphic framework and reservoir characterization of the carbonate-evaporites system of the Arab Formation. Four second-order sequences from mud-dominated basinal limestones, grain-supported oolitic and skeletal shoals, and lagoonal to supratidal anhydrite-rich deposits were interpreted. In addition, four sequence boundaries (SB) and three maximum flooding surfaces (MFS) correlated with MFS J80, J90,…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Quantifying and accurately measuring bulk permeability in bioturbated strata remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining representative samples that adequately capture connected networks controlling fluid flow. These representative volumes often exceed the laboratory-scale testing. Previously, permeability assessments for such large samples have relied on numerical simulations, where direct permeability measurements for these large burrowed strata remain challenging. However, recent advancements in computed tomography (CT) imaging and 3D printing technologies have enabled high-resolution reconstruction of burrow networks, which can then be scaled down to laboratory-compatible sizes. Despite this progress, issues persist, particularly with 3D-printed replicas produced via fused deposition modeling (FDM). These models frequently fail under the confining pressures applied during permeability testing due to structural deficiencies and fluid leakage. After the failure of ten FDM-printed replicas, this study identifies critical parameters for achieving mechanically robust replicas. Specifically, Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) PETG (filament demonstrated markedly superior load-bearing capacity and pressure tolerance compared to Polylactic Acid PLA, significantly minimizing sample failure. Furthermore, the use of 100% matrix infill was found to be crucial for maintaining structural integrity, despite the longer print times required. Fina…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Smart Chemical Modifier (SeMAR) is a crucial enhanced oil recovery technique for petroleum production, particularly in the heterogeneous sandstone system. This study focuses on the application of SeMAR for enhancing oil recovery in the Hemiar oilfield, located in the Masila Basin of Eastern Yemen. In the Hemiar oilfield, the S2 sandstone reservoir presents complex mineralogy due the depositional and diagenetic processes, exhibiting low permeability system. The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of SeMAR on the behavior of the heavy oil collected from 19 core samples in diffrent burial depths in the Hemiar-21exploration well. In this case, different chemical formulations of the SeMAR were used to achieve a precise the efficiency of heavy oil displacement using different laboratory tests such as phase behavior, compatibility, spontaneous imbibition, emulsion viscosity measurement, and core rock stability. The highlighted results demonstrate that the SeMAR formulations improve the efficiency of heavy oil displacement from the heterogeneous sandstone reservoir system in the Hemiar Field, particularly 1% S16A formulation. The 1% S16A was the most effective surfactant, exhibiting the lowest viscosity (7.0 cp.) at a 50% oil concentration, which enhanced the oil mobility and recovery efficiency. The results of this study provide promising insights into the optimization of SeMAR formulations to maximize oil recovery in the Hemiar Field, with a relatively hig…&#10;Venue: Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The effectiveness of an iron nitrate catalyst (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) was experimentally investigates to improve the efficiency of steam injection for in-situ hydrothermal conversion of Domanik low-permeable shale rock, with the aim of improving both the quantity and quality of produced synthetic oil. The experiments were performed under hydrothermal condition at 300℃ and 350℃ for 24 hours and at 400℃ for 3 hours. The generated synthetic oils and produced gases was analyzed using GC, GC-MS chromatography, gas chromatography, elemental and SARA analysis. The obtained results revealed that the addition of iron nitrate led to a significant increase in synthetic oil yield by 2.56% at 300℃, 5.39% at 350℃ and 4.87% at 400℃, as opposed to non-catalytic conditions. The optimal condition was identified at 350℃, which yielded higher amounts of light n-alkanes (C9-C20) compared to heavy n-alkanes. The results of SARA analysis and GC-MS also showed high aliphatic hydrocarbons content within the generated synthetic oil. Furthermore, XRD analysis revealed that the presence of iron sulfides (FeS2) and iron oxides (Fe2O3) plays a significant role in facilitating the effective desulfurization of bitumen and kerogen. These findings highlight the catalytic potential of water-soluble iron nitrate in hydrothermal treatment, offering valuable insights for optimizing synthetic oil production from oil shale.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

The primary focus is on the geochemical processes occurring during seawater-groundwater mixing with emphasis on mineral dissolution/precipitation, cation exchange, adsorption, and trace element mobilization. 3D lab-scale physical experiments were carried out to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using local aquifer materials, groundwater, and seawater. The lab experiments were conducted under various hydrogeological conditions and variable control factors to simulate groundwater dynamics in sandy coastal aquifers impacted by seawater intrusion. Post-experiment advanced geochemical analysis was performed to describe the chemical change of groundwater characteristics during seawater intrusion. Inverse geochemical modeling was performed to identify the geochemical processes that controlled the water chemistry during the seawater intrusion experiment. The lab experiment data were used to validate geochemical models. The integrated lab-scale experiment and inverse geochemical modeling reveal that the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers has significantly impacted the groundwater quality through increasing salinity and trace element mobilization. The study showed that significant changes in groundwater quality occurred during low pumping and no recharge scenarios …&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Palynomorph Darkness Index (PDI) is a fully quantitative optical method for assessing thermal maturity which has been established as a rapid and low-cost ‘add-on’ to palynostratigraphic investigations, especially in pre-Devonian sediments. Here, we applied the PDI method to Silurian strata in Saudi Arabia to enhance calibration of Acritarch PDI to vitrinite reflectance (VRo) via Vitrinite Reflectance Equivalents (VREs) such as pyrolysis-based Tmax determination, and graptolite and chitinozoan reflectance. Unoxidised palynological concentrates were obtained from core samples from various sections in Saudi Arabia from the early Silurian (Qalibah Formation) and a maturity range from immature through the oil, condensate and gas windows to the postmature stage. PDI measurements were taken on suitable acritarch taxa using a transmitted light optical microscope and a digital camera. The PDI values obtained were correlated with VREs derived from Tmax, graptolite reflectance and chitinozoan reflectance. Published PDI – VRo correlations established in Devonian-Carboniferous sections in the eastern USA were also considered. The present results confirm that acritarch PDI can be successfully applied for thermal maturity estimation, especially in pre-Devonian age, organic-rich sediments, where most of the available alternative methods show weak correlation toVRo. The most suitable acritarchs for PDI determination are the Veryhachium / Neoveryhachium Group. Preliminary results sugg…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Hyperspectral sensor measured the reflected electromagnetic wave within visible, near, middle, and long-wave infrared intervals. In geology, Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) and Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) wavelength ranges have been proven to be useful to detect mineralogy variation of a material. The purest material is usually unable to be captured in many cases, especially in distance measurements such as airborne or satellite. Each measurement, a single pixel in an image or point, usually captures the spectra from the mixture of several minerals. Spectral unmixing is a method to estimate the abundance of constituent minerals and their distribution in the mixed material of an object being measured. Using endmembers retrieved from the purest endmember measured or spectral libraries, the relative composition (abundance) of every material is quantified by analyzing the influence of the endmember&apos;s spectra on the noisy/impure spectra of the given mixed material. In this project, the abundance of Calcite, Dolomite, and Quartz of rock powder samples from carbonate outcrops was quantified using several techniques, including linear, PLSR, and machine learning assisted hyperspectral unmixing methods, and the results were compared with other conventional determination methods. The powder samples are measured using a handheld hyperspectral measurement device, a spectroradiometer, that has a 2 cm measured surface.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Mississippi Valey Type (MVT) deposits are significant sources of lead and zinc, hosted in dolostone and limestone within platform carbonate sequences. These deposits are characterized by a lack of magmatic source, deriving metals from basinal brines. Carbonate-hosted ore deposits present exploration challenges due to limited mineralogical alteration halos. However, stable carbon and oxygen (C-O) isotopes in surrounding carbonates can reveal extensive alteration zones, potentially spanning for long distances, serving as indicators of ore body proximity. Studies have shown a connection between MVT deposits and petroleum systems, with some Pb-Zn deposits coexisting with oil and gas reservoirs, suggesting a genetic link between mineralization processes and hydrocarbon accumulation. This study explores the application of C-O isotope data as a mineral exploration tool within the geological framework of Saudi Arabia. The research focused on Miocene carbonates in the Mydian Terrane, which was chosen because they are similar in age to the Jabal Dhaylan deposit, the only recognized MVT deposit in Saudi Arabia. It&apos;s important to note that MVT deposits typically occur in clusters or belts, often containing multiple deposits.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This paper introduces a novel method for enhancing drillbit tracking using passive seismic recordings. The method leverages surface passive seismic-while-drilling data, cross-correlated with pilot recordings from various locations along the drill string, to accurately focus, interpret, locate, and visualize drillbit positions. This approach offers an independent and precise estimation of well positions. The method interprets these images as probability distribution functions to simultaneously estimate locations and positional uncertainties. The proposed technique addresses the limitations of traditional well placement methods by providing high-resolution drillbit source images and continuous positional updates. This is particularly advantageous in complex geological settings where precise well placement is critical. The method&apos;s ability to deliver accurate drillbit locations without being confined to a spatial grid enhances its applicability across various drilling scenarios. Both synthetic and field data tests validate the method’s efficacy, demonstrating its robustness and reliability. The results indicate that this seismic-based approach can serve as a complementary technique to traditional magnetic and gyro Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technologies, potentially mitigating cumulative errors and improving overall well placement accuracy.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Accurate determination of near-surface velocity is essential for calculating static corrections for seismic data, as neglecting shallow velocity can lead to significant misplacement of deeper seismic reflectors. However, traditional methods for inverting refracted traveltimes data are often computationally intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel machine learning-based inversion framework that predicts the thickness and velocity of near-surface layers from refracted traveltimes data. Our approach utilizes a data-driven methodology to approximate the relationship between seismic traveltimes and corresponding velocity and thickness, reducing ambiguities in seismic inversion results, particularly without sufficient prior information. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model using synthetic traveltimes datasets and evaluated its performance on synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately estimate layer thicknesses and velocities with high consistency between predicted and actual values. Furthermore, applying the machine learning approach to a field dataset acquired over a dune in Saudi Arabia, comprising 37 receivers at 2 m intervals, yielded results consistent with borehole data. The proposed machine learning framework offers several advantages over traditional inversion techniques, including automatically identifying valuable inversion information without prior knowledge, avo…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study presents an enhanced reserve estimation approach that mitigates the limitations of conventional inversion methods, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making during exploration. The training process used acoustic impedance (AI) logs as the target variable and depth, two-way travel time, and seismic attributes at the well log scale as inputs. The models employed multilayer perceptrons, random forests, and extra tree regressions to predict the AI, which was then compared to the BLIMP (band-limited impedance inversion) data. The methodology emphasizes selecting suitable cutoffs or thresholds of porosity and permeability for optimal performance. Using cutoff values that match porosity and permeability extremes reduces error and improves reservoir parameter estimation for net pay. The hydrocarbon pore volume is subsequently computed, followed by the estimation of reserves and economic value. Compared with the available cited ground truth data (1.8310e+11 STB and 3.9549e+12 SAR), the ETR results in more accurate reserves and values (1.7174e+11 STB and 3.7096e+12 SAR). These results are also supported by the ETR&apos;s empirical value (a=0.1584) being closest to the value of the ground truth (a=0.1585). We conclude that, compared with the ground truth, the ML models exhibit varying performance, with the accurate trend of ETR &amp;amp;gt; RFR &amp;amp;gt; MLPR. In contrast, the values of the BLIMP are smaller than those of the ETR, provided that the threshold choices m…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract We present a physics-informed neural network approach for full-waveform inversion (FWI) that embeds a Deep Image Prior (DIP) U-Net within the inversion loop and applies explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret the learned model. Starting from a decimated Marmousi velocity model, we generate synthetic seismic data via 2D acoustic wave propagation. A smoothed version of the true model initializes a randomly initialized U-Net (the DIP), which is pretrained to replicate the smoothed model. Thereafter, the DIP&apos;s weights replace the cell-wise velocity parameters in FWI, and an iterative optimizer adjusts these weights to minimize discrepancies between observed and simulated waveforms. The resulting high-resolution velocity model arises from physics-constrained learning. To reveal the network&apos;s decision process, we compute attribution maps using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Integrated Gradients, and occlusion sensitivity. These maps highlight the spatial features; primarily high-contrast layers and anomalies that drive the DIP&apos;s output. Comparative analyses of true vs. predicted models, residuals, and combined depth/lateral sensitivity profiles confirm that the deep model captures essential subsurface structures. This framework enhances transparency in seismic inversion by linking data-driven models to geophysical knowledge, thus bridging the gap between &quot;black-box&quot; deep learning and interpretable imaging.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract In line with Saudi Arabia&apos;s commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, the country is actively exploring its geothermal potential, with most planned initiatives focusing on the pre-rift basement formations and geothermal provinces of the Arabian Shield. However, one of the limitations of targeting basement rocks is that they tend to have very low permeabilities, in many cases requiring to implement hydraulic fracturing to enhance connectivity. This work aims to evaluate the potential of producing geothermal energy from porous syn-rift basins’ sediments through reservoir static and dynamic modeling. The methodology involves constructing a representative 3D geological model of the Al-Wajh Formation, utilizing basin and well data, along with information from analogous geological Formations. The workflow incorporates seismic data, well-logs, structural maps, and petrophysical data to create a 3D representation of the geological Formation. A methodology is introduced here to estimate porosity reduction caused by compaction for the deepest parts of the basins where temperatures tend to increase and where, in many cases, no data is available, allowing to estimate the potential production rates for these high temperature and low permeability zones. By integrating this model with numerical simulations, we provide an understanding of the potential rates and temperatures achievable in these types of basins together with the potential thermal power and electric power that c…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study investigates Middle Miocene carbonate platform outcrops along the Arabian margin of the Red Sea. These platforms, formed on footwalls of major rift faults, serve as analogues for fault-block carbonate reservoirs. The study focuses on platform geometry, facies distribution, and diagenetic features, which are relevant for exploration models and reservoir characterization. The study integrates field observations, satellite imagery, and stratigraphic analysis across an 800 km stretch of coastline. The platforms are dated to the Late Burdigalian to Early Langhian (16-14 Ma) and rest unconformably on Precambrian basement and syn-rift sedimentary rocks. Structural control results in elongated fringing platform geometries aligned with fault scarps of normal faults. Fore-reef coral-algal rudstone facies are well preserved, whereas back-reef deposits are preserved only in some locations. Diagenetic alterations include marine cementation, meteoric dissolution, dolomitization, and localized Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) mineralization with Zn, Pb, Cu sulfides, barite, and Mn oxides. These features reflect multiple diagenetic stages and variable fluid histories. The platforms exhibit consistent structural and sedimentological patterns along the margin, highlighting the influence of tectonic setting on carbonate development. The results support the application of these outcrops as analogues for subsurface systems in rift-related carbonate plays.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Near-surface deformation zones present considerable imaging challenges due to complex structural geometries, heterogeneous lithologies, and elevated ambient noise, particularly in urban and infrastructurerich environments. This study investigates a 30-meter-wide deformation outcrop within the Dammam Dome, Eastern Saudi Arabia, using 2D and 3D seismic tomography techniques complemented by detailed mineralogical analysis. The 2D seismic refraction survey was conducted along a 360-meter profile using a cabled geophone system, while the 3D survey employed a wireless nodal array comprising 108 receivers and 385 shot points. The receivers were deployed along six in-line profiles with 8-meter spacing in both in-line and cross-line directions, and sources were distributed along 11 profiles with 4-meter offsets. Super-virtual refraction interferometry (SVI) was applied to both datasets to enhance signal-to-noise ratios and improve the continuity of first-arrival traveltimes in the challenging field environment. The resulting 2D tomograms revealed a prominent high-velocity anomaly ranging from 1210 to 1650 m/s within the upper 20 meters of the subsurface. A comparable deformation zone was observed in the 3D model, with velocities ranging from 650 to 800 m/s, delineating lateral and vertical heterogeneities consistent with structural deformation. Mineralogical analyses using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) confirmed dolomite as the dominant mineral phase, w…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Organic-rich source rocks play a vital role in hydrocarbon exploration and serve as valuable records of past environmental conditions. This study investigates the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Type II-S marine source rocks of Jordan (JSR) to examine organic and inorganic compositional variability corresponding to paleoenvironmental conditions during deposition. The identification of distinct geochemical cycles in these source rocks contributes to a deeper understanding of the depositional settings and paleoenvironmental dynamics influencing organic matter distribution. The study utilized a comprehensive analytical approach, including Spectral Gamma Ray (SGR), RockEval pyrolysis, XRD, XRF, ICP, SEM-EDX, and petrographic examination. These techniques were employed to evaluate the organic and inorganic geochemical composition and distribution of organic matter at both micro and nanoscale levels. A research well drilled in the Al-Lajjun Basin of central Jordan provided a pristine JSR core interval for the detailed geochemical analysis. The characterization of the samples was carried out to understand the lithologic and geochemical variation within the rock formation and correlate it with paleoenvironmental changes. The JSR is an organic-rich, type IIS, carbonate-dominated source rock interval, deposited during a significant nutrient upwelling event in the Cretaceous time period.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Unconventional hydrocarbon source rocks represent significant potential worldwide. This study aims to examine the characteristics of natural fractures within unconventional hydrocarbon source rocks from the Eastern Mediterranean, focusing on their stratigraphic distribution, timing, and formation mechanisms. Understanding these factors is vital for the broader context of hydrocarbon exploration and resource management on a global scale. This research employs a multi-faceted approach, integrating core samples, and geochemical data to analyze natural fractures in organic-rich Upper Cretaceous source rocks, specifically in Jordan, which has relevance to similar geological settings worldwide. The study includes detailed fracture core analysis, assessing the intensity, orientation, and filling materials of main fracture networks. Systematic sampling was conducted for both fracture geochemistry (inorganic and organic), isotopic analysis, and petrography, employing advanced microscopic techniques, including optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study reveals a diverse set of natural fractures within these source rocks, consisting of calcite-filled, silica-filled, and bitumen-filled fractures, displaying both vertical and horizontal (bedding-parallel) orientations. Notably, the lithological characteristics significantly influence the distribution and formation of fractures; for instance, calcite-filled veins are primarily observed in calcareous mudstone and car…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract High-resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was conducted to characterize the vertical and lateral distribution of elemental compositions in six carbonate mudstone cores from the Late Cretaceous unconventional plays in North America. The primary objective was to develop a rapid, efficient, cost-effective, and non-destructive method for analyzing mudstone cores. This goal was achieved by combining and analyzing representative elements from each group, including Ca (carbonate-associated element), Si, Al, Fe, Ti, K (terrigenous-associated elements), and Mo, Ni, V, and Cu (redox-sensitive trace elements). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) were utilized to identify chemofacies and establish chronostratigraphic subdivisions, subsequently facilitating correlations between different wells. Each dataset has a generated several clusters, and their validity has been confirmed by comparing them with core samples and measurements. This process led to the selection of the most appropriate cluster/chemofacies. Each cluster/chemofacies represents a major lithofacies defined by its chemical composition. Five rock classes/chemofacies based on elemental compositions have been identified in this study, including chalk/limestone, marly limestone, organic-rich mudstone, sandstone, and mixed mudstone. Additionally, through the integration of core measurements and chemostratigraphy, multiple stratigraphic zones have been iden…&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The geomechanical properties of rocks are crucial for understanding reservoir behavior and variations in quality, particularly in complex carbonate systems. While various approaches, such as well logs and seismic data, have been employed to characterize these properties in carbonate formations, achieving accurate results from these proxies remains challenging. The Middle Jurassic Tuwaiq Mountain Formation (TMF) in Saudi Arabia is of significant importance for both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon exploration. However, limited research exists on the influence of depositional facies on the geomechanical properties of the TMF and the resulting implications for reservoir quality and heterogeneity. Thus, this study examines the rock mechanical behavior, geochemical composition, petrophysical properties,lithofacies and their interrelationships within the TMF. In the study area, TMF consists of three principal depositional facies, which are bioclastic Wackstone, peloidal grainstoneand bioclastic-peloidal packstone. The maximum and minimum average values for uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), compressional and shear wave velocities measured were 148MPa and 34MPa; 5924m/s and 3307m/s; 3135m/s and 1861m/s, respectively. The average porosity values obtained are ranging from a minimum of 2.3% to a maximum of 19.2%.

      <description>Abstract: Silica diagenesis plays a critical yet understudied role in modifying the hydrocarbon potential of organic-rich carbonate source rocks. This review systematically examines how silica transformations—from biogenic opal to quartz—fundamentally alter rock properties through three key mechanisms: First, mineralogical reorganization, where silica dissolution creates secondary porosity while cementation occludes pore throats, directly impacting fluid flow pathways. Second, geochemical feedbacks, including pH-driven carbonate dissolution and catalytic effects on organic matter maturation that influence hydrocarbon generation kinetics. Third, pore network evolution, where silica-induced microfractures provide migration conduits but heterogeneous cementation can trap hydrocarbons. The synthesis highlights three novel insights: (1) The timing of silica diagenesis relative to hydrocarbon generation determines whether pores remain open for migration or become sealed; (2) Microscale silica-carbonate interactions control reservoir quality more significantly than previously recognized; and (3) Modern analytical techniques reveal complex diagenetic histories that challenge traditional models. By integrating petrographic, geochemical, and petrophysical evidence, this work establishes a predictive framework for evaluating how silica diagenesis impacts petroleum systems, from source rock maturation to trap integrity. The findings are particularly relevant for unconventional carbonate reservoirs…&#10;Topics: Diagenesis, Geology, Carbonate, Geochemistry, Carbonate rock&#10;Venue: Frontiers in Earth Science&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 2</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is increasingly used for vertical seismic profiling (VSP) due to its high spatial sampling density and reduced costs relative to conventional geophone-based methods. This paper presents a large-scale dual-well DAS VSP survey and a comprehensive workflow for data conditioning and early-arrival full-waveform inversion (FWI) implemented using the deep learning (DL) framework PyTorch. Two adjacent wells, 4 km deep and 1.5 km apart, were instrumented with fiber on tubing. Dense land acquisition spanning 4.5 km along the line connecting the wells features a single dual-fiber interrogator and high levels of noise driven by the arid environment. We present a fully automated workflow that allows processing of such data introducing zero-offset supergather that is kinematically inverted for initial model building and synthetic-driven muting strategy to mitigate the effect of the noise. We also introduce pressure to strain-acceleration transform to accommodate DAS simulations using an acoustic solver and source function centroid constraints to adaptively update the source function throughout the iterations while preserving the source timing. Our results confirm the feasibility of combining DAS data and a DL framework for high-resolution velocity inversion in a desert environment with fiber deployed on tubing.&#10;Topics: Geology, Dual (grammatical number), Philosophy, Linguistics&#10;Venue: The Leading Edge&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

Static correction, a crucial initial step in seismic reflection processing, is employed to mitigate the impact of shallow surface layers. In this study, we investigate the variations in seismic properties along the uppermost part of mature and developing sabkhas. We employed high‐resolution seismic experiments with geophone spacing of 10 cm to explore the upper tens of centimeters. Conventional surveys with a 2 m spacing complement this approach to investigate deeper layers. Both sabkhas exhibit a unique characteristic of a partially saturated zone, which affects the seismic velocity, leading to lower velocities and consequently influencing the accuracy of the static correction. The high‐resolution surveys demonstrated superior accuracy to conventional approaches in determining the top of the partial saturation zone and hardground layer, hence resulting in a more reliable velocity delineation. Moreover, velocities derived from conventional, replacement, and tomogram approaches resulted in unreliable static corrections in mature coastal sabkha compared with developing inland sabkha, attributed to the considerable geological complexity that is character…&#10;Topics: Geology, Seismology, Geophysics, Oceanography&#10;Venue: Earth and Space Science&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis of zeolite from kaolinite-rich saprolite from Al-Habala Area, Saudi Arabia, providing insights on kaolinite as an economically viable precursor for zeolite formation. This study was conducted using hydrothermal rectors with a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution at temperatures of 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250 °C over a duration of 336 h. At 150 °C, the dissolution of the clay and feldspar grains began, forming amorphous silica, from which mordenite rods formed. Increased temperatures promoted the formation of cubic analcime crystals at 200 °C to well-developed trapezohedron aggregates at 250 °C. The mineralogical transformations were characterized using SEM, XRD, and ICP-OES analyses, revealing the role of temperature on the morphologies, compositional alteration, and decreasing Na concentrations correlating with the formation of analcime. The newly formed analcime closely matched the composition of natural analcime from different basins. The results confirm that saprolite can effectively serve as a medium for zeolite synthesis, highlighting its potential for cost-effective industrial applications and expanding the understanding of kaolinite-to-zeolite conversion pathways.&#10;Topics: Saprolite, Kaolinite, Geochemistry, Transformation (genetics), Geology&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The population of Africa is growing at a rate of over 2.3% per year, the highest rate of growth among the continents, and it contained the world&apos;s 20 fastest-growing economies in 2024. Its economy is partly driven by its large resources of minerals, oil and diamonds, and its rapidly growing population. Geoscience research, knowledge and application will be vital for the sustainable use of these resources. A bibliometric analysis from 2014 to 2024 reveals that Africa is under-represented in elements of geoscience research for the energy transition (carbon capture and storage, critical minerals, geothermal), as well as in advanced data science, for example machine learning and artificial intelligence, both of which are likely to form a part of the geoscience solutions to energy transition challenges. This representation is shown in terms of the small number of papers published on Africa, and more crucially those on Africa that are led by Africa-based researchers. The situation could be improved by provision of competitive salaries for African academics, as well as encouraging foreign researchers to develop collaborators in Africa, including building more sustainability and less dependency into African research funding. Aid ‘paternalism’ can be counteracted by schemes that encourage local agency, and capacity building in Africa.&#10;Topics: Earth science, Energy (signal processing), Transition (genetics), Geography, Geology&#10;Venue: Geoenergy&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract In this study, four oil seepages and ten organic-rich shale samples of the Paleocene Waipawa Formation from outcrop sections in East Coast Basin, New Zealand were studied. Multi-scale organic geochemical analyses, including total organic carbon (TOC) content, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, biomarker and carbon isotope measurements were conducted and used to determine the characteristics of the organic matter in seep oil and shale samples and then to learn more about their genetic relationship. The studied Waipawa shale samples are characterized by high TOC content up to 10.84wt. %, and mixed kerogen types, with mainly hydrogen-rich kerogen Types II and II/III, suggesting a good oil- and gas- source rock, with substantial potential for oil generation. The studied Waipawa shale sediments are characterized by Pr/Ph ratios between 0.90 and 3.40 and generally low values of C32R/C30 hopane ratio of less than 1, indicating that these shale sediments are clay-rich facies and were deposited under anoxic to relatively oxic environmental conditions. The shale sediments of the Waipawa Formation are also characterzied by high ratios of C23tri/C24tri, C25tri/C26tri, and C24tre/C22tri tricyclic terpanes, alongside high abundance of C27 and C29 regular steranes compared to C28 regular sterane, further indicating a mixed organic matter, with high contributions of marine organic matter input.

      <description>Abstract: This study presents an analysis of the morphology of sand particles and their contacts using high-resolution microcomputer tomography (CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raw 3D images are filtered, binarized, and smoothed to distinguish the granular space from the void space. The 3D granular space is segmented via an advanced adaptive watershed algorithm. The grain segmentation is used for contact detection and contact network extraction. The topography of each grain is diverse, fascinating, and shaped by a landscape of ridges and basins. This topography is reflected in the way the grains come into contact. Unlike the common conception of point contacts, we observe contacts over large surface areas, concave-like contacts due to ridge-basin interactions, and doughnut-like contacts due to incomplete contact between high ridges and deep basins. Although most of the interactions are due to a single contact, a significant number of multiple contact interactions are observed. SEM images show two key features: First, the sand surfaces are not quartz-clean but are coated with clay particles. Second, the basins are not empty but are partially filled with silt particles that are cemented with clay. This is a comprehensive experimental investigation to determine the basis for advanced contact models of the micromechanical investigation of the strength of sand aggregates and wave propagation herein. The proposed micro- and nanocharacterization of contact morphologies paves the w…&#10;Topics: Morphology (biology), Geology, Paleontology&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The extent of desiccation in deep enclosed basins has been debated for over 50 years. Here we combine seismic, biostratigraphic, and strontium isotope data to document a deep desiccation event across the Red Sea basin that ended 6.2 million years ago. This event exposed the seafloor to erosion, forming an angular unconformity that decapitated Middle Miocene salt diapirs and truncated Late Miocene layered anhydrites. The unconformity is overlain by Messinian-Pleistocene pelagic carbonates and reef platforms, reflecting an abrupt shift from evaporitic to open marine conditions. The desiccation was likely triggered by the onset of the Messinian salinity crisis in the Mediterranean and it ended with a flood from the Gulf of Aden, which incised a 320 km long canyon through the volcanic Mandab and Hanish sills. This desiccation marks the final disconnection of the Red Sea from the Mediterranean and its initial connection to the Indian Ocean.&#10;Topics: Salinity, Desiccation, Oceanography, Structural basin, Erosion&#10;Venue: Communications Earth &amp; Environment&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Manual interpretation of sedimentary structures in core-based analyses is critical for understanding subsurface geology but remains time-intensive, expert-dependent, and susceptible to bias. This study investigates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate structure identification in core images, focusing on siliciclastic deposits from deltaic, shoreface, fluvial, and lacustrine environments. Two object detection models—YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN—were trained on annotated datasets comprising 15 sedimentary structure types. YOLOv4 achieved high precision (up to 95%) with faster training and shorter inference times (3.2 s/image) compared to Faster R-CNN (2.5 s/image) under consistent batch size and hardware conditions. Although Faster R-CNN reached a higher mean average precision (94.44%), it exhibited lower recall, particularly for frequently occurring structures. Both models faced challenges in distinguishing morphologically similar features, such as mud drapes and bioturbated media. Performance declined slightly in tests involving previously unseen datasets (Split III), indicating limitations in generalization across varied core imagery. Despite these challenges, the results demonstrate the promise of deep learning for streamlining core interpretation, reducing manual effort, and enhancing reproducibility. This study establishes a robust framework for advancing automated facies analysis in sedimentological research and geoscientific applications.&#10;Topics: Convolutional neural network, Identification (biology), Artificial intelligence, Computer science, Siliciclastic&#10;Venue: PLoS ONE&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Benthic foraminifera play crucial roles in marine ecosystems and serve as valuable bioindicators of ecological conditions and environmental changes. Despite their importance, comprehensive basin-wide assessments of their diversity patterns remain scarce, particularly in complex environments like the Arabian Gulf. This study reveals the variation of benthic foraminiferal diversity within the gulf and provides insights into its distribution patterns and relationships with environmental gradients. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of benthic foraminiferal occurrences from published literature and public databases, encompassing more than 492 species from nine orders, 39 superfamilies, 89 families, and 150 genera. Using an ensemble of species distribution models, we modelled the spatial patterns of individual species and stack these predictions to estimate foraminiferal species richness across the basin. We documented a pronounced north-south diversity gradient that differs from typical latitudinal patterns observed in larger marine systems. Our methodological framework identifies bathymetry and dissolved oxygen as primary drivers of foraminiferal distributions when averaged across all species, with significant influence from iron concentration and salinity. However, individual species showed diverse environmental responses, with variables of lower mean importance often exerting primary control on specific taxa, highlighting the ecological specialization that enables such high d…&#10;Topics: Benthic zone, Oceanography, Diversity (politics), Structural basin, Geography&#10;Venue: PLoS ONE&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Heavy metal (HM) contamination in marine sediments is a critical environmental concern due to its potential ecological and human health impacts. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the spatial and temporal evolution of HM contamination in Arabian Gulf sediments over a 33-year period (1991–2024). Contamination levels were evaluated using key sediment quality indices such as the contamination factor (CF), geoaccumulation index (I g ₑₒ), pollution load index (PLI), and ecological risk index (ERI) based on available meta-data. Spatial analysis revealed that marine sediments along the Iranian and Saudi Arabian coasts exhibited higher contamination levels compared to those of other Gulf countries. This elevated contamination is likely attributed to industrial discharges, oil spills and effluent releases from desalination plants. Arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) emerged as the primary toxic contributors to sediment pollution. Overall, HM contamination status in the region is predominantly low to moderate, with localized hotspots near industrialized coastal zones. The study highlights the need for scientifically informed waste management strategies to mitigate HM contamination, particularly in nearshore environments impacted by industrial activities. Furthermore, it recommends the implementation of continuous monitoring programs to track temporal trends and identify emerging contamination sources. These findings provide critic…&#10;Topics: Contamination, Environmental science, Pollution, Sediment, Marine ecosystem&#10;Venue: Environmental Monitoring and Assessment&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 2</description>

      <description>Abstract: In this study, we focused on improving acoustic impedance (AI) in seismic exploration. AI is a crucial parameter estimated by multiplying the density of a material by the velocity of an acoustic wave passing through it. A low AI in sandstones and carbonates often indicates high porosity, which enhances hydrocarbon accumulation. Accurate AI estimation is thus critical for reliable hydrocarbon exploration. To refine the AI estimation, we used stacking and voting regression algorithms, with depth, two-way travel time (TWTT), and nine seismic attributes as inputs. All models were implemented using scikit-learn . The VStaR model achieved superior predictive performance ([Formula: see text]= 0.9973) and yielded a more accurate fitting parameter (a = 0.1584) in the acoustic impedance-porosity transformation compared to the VSR ([Formula: see text]= 0.9775, a = 0.1583). The VSR approach made the voting of a top-performing base model with two less predictive base models, as used in the existing literature. Relative to the true and BLIMP-derived impedance, the fitting accuracy followed the order of true &gt; VStaR &gt; VSR &gt; BLIMP. While VStaR required longer computation time (≈ 400 s), it reduced RMSE by 14.74% compared to the top-performing base model. VStaR outperformed all evaluated models based on MSE, RMSE, and [Formula: see text] metrics. The novelty of the VStaR method based on hyperparameters lies in its superior performance in obtaining a more precise prediction of acoustic impedan…&#10;Topics: Voting, Computer science, Inversion (geology), Algorithm, Regression&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 3</description>

      <description>Abstract: The Central Arabian Basin is a sedimentary basin that contains a significant number of hydrocarbon reserves. In addition, the Mesozoic succession has the most petroleum system elements. However, publicly available subsurface data for the Central Arabian Basin are scarce. Therefore, our study successfully utilizes wellbore and 2D seismic reflection data from the Central Arabian Basin to reveal the sedimentary processes, depositional environment, and evolution of Mesozoic deposits. Six horizons with onlap and truncation seismic reflection termination, hummocky, subparallel, onlap fill, and chaotic structures with recognizable stratal pattern seismic reflection configurations are interpreted. The lithologies of the Mesozoic deposits are limestone, dolomite, anhydrite, sandstone, and shales. The Mesozoic deposits in the study area were deposited in the shallow marine environment of an intrashelf basin with tidal channels, reefs and transgressive shale depositional elements. Our workflow provides an interpretation of the stratigraphic evolution and depositional environment of Mesozoic deposits in the Central Arabian Basin and could also be applied to a basin with a similar geological setting worldwide.&#10;Topics: Mesozoic, Stratigraphy, Geology, Structural basin, Paleontology&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: Water purification is significantly inhibited by the ineffective removal of boron from aqueous solutions, particularly because traditional membrane-based purification exhibits poor removal of neutral boric acid. This study investigates the efficiency of a Mg-Al layered double hydroxide electrode supported on carbon paper for boron removal by capacitive deionization (CDI). Cyclic voltammetry was used to confirm the capacitive properties of the electrode, which displayed quasi-rectangular profiles with notable reversibility and rate capability. Chronoamperometric observations revealed a voltage-dependent electrosorption activity; 1.2 V showed optimal charge storage and boron removal performance. At this voltage, the system achieved a mean deionization capacity of 2.58 mg/g, over 94 % boron removal within 20 min, and a peak charge efficiency of 79 %, accompanied by a moderate energy consumption of 0.82 kWh/m3. The system exhibited a notable pH dependence and the optimal performance at pH 11 correlated with the dominance of the negatively charged borate ion (B(OH)⁻). Increasing the pH increased the capacity and rate in the Ragone plot (mean deionization capacity vs. mean deionization rate). Although system efficiency dropped slightly to 88 % after 120 min of operation, the electrode showed remarkable cyclic stability across several charge-discharge cycles. Dynamic variations in real-time pH monitoring during CDI were observed, with an initial increase during charging, followed by…&#10;Topics: Capacitive deionization, Materials science, Hydroxide, Composite number, Boron&#10;Venue: Chemical Engineering Journal Advances&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The petrogenesis and metamorphism of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357 (Atlantis Massif, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) mafic rocks is the focus of this paper. At least two phases of magmatism are identified. Later Phase I metamorphosed mafic intrusive rocks (MMIs) are moderately to extremely chloritized, recording loss on ignition (LOI) of 3.33–9.99 wt%, and latest Phase II basalts are exceptionally fresh, with LOI of 0.09–1.03 wt%. Phase I MMIs have Fe-chromite identical to Atlantis Massif serpentinites that have undergone melt-impregnation and Phase II basalt Cr-spinels are analogous to those of Atlantis Massif peridotites that have not undergone secondary melt-impregnation. Whole-rock Cr/Y relations of the Phase II basalt record melt fractions ( F ) of c . 16–25% and melt–liquid equilibria established for Phase II basalt olivine yield crystallization temperatures of 1173–1219°C similar to mid-ocean ridge basalt ( c . 1125–1290°C). Trivariant plots of Na 2 O–CaO–MgO and XRD analysis confirm extreme chloritization of the Phase I MMIs. Phase I MMI spinel is predominantly Fe-chromite that formed under amphibolite-facies conditions ( c . 500°C). Subsequent to peridotite exhumation, serpentinization and Phase I magmatism, an episode (or episodes) of asthenospheric upwelling resulted in contact metamorphism caused by Phase II magmatism.&#10;Topics: Petrogenesis, Magmatism, Geology, Mafic, Metamorphism&#10;Venue: Journal of the Geological Society&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>
