            The Integrative Dashboard is a web-based visualization tool designed to support research exploration,
            collaboration mapping, and knowledge discovery across research programs. It was created by{" "}

            . All numbers and charts on the main pages (topics, institutions, members, and publications)
            are computed from CSV files that are generated from cached OpenAlex bibliographic data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">In practical terms, you can use the dashboard to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
            <li>Explore publication and citation output by topic, institution, and member.</li>
            <li>See how topical coverage and institutional collaboration patterns evolve over time.</li>
            <li>Inspect individual publications and follow links out to their persistent identifiers.</li>
            <li>Navigate between summary metrics, detailed tables, and co-author network views.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Data pipeline</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
            <li>Authors and their identifying info are defined in simple CSV files under the data folder.</li>
            <li>
              Node scripts download and cache each author&apos;s works from the OpenAlex data source,
              then export consolidated CSV tables for works, topics, institutions, and author-level metrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the build step, these CSVs are converted into generated TypeScript tables that
              are loaded by the dashboard at runtime. All visible counts (publications, citations,
              topics, institutions, and member statistics) are derived from these tables.
            </li>
            <li>Co-author visualizations use cached JSON snapshots stored under the author-data folder.</li>
            <li>
              An RSS feed of recent publications is generated from the works CSV and published as{" "}
              <code>/rss.xml</code>, which can be subscribed to from most feed readers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Year-range, topic, institution, and author filters in the interface slice this
              precomputed data so all interactions remain fast and local, without live API calls.
            </li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
            <li>Recorded names may differ from source records, and publication name spellings can vary.</li>
            <li>Similar or identical author names can appear worldwide and may be difficult to disambiguate.</li>
            <li>An individual author may publish under multiple name variants over time.</li>
            <li>Last-name spelling can be inconsistent (for example, adding or removing a hyphen or accent).</li>
            <li>
              Co-author graphs are based on cached OpenAlex snapshots and may include works that are
              not present in the current CSV tables, or omit very recent updates from the source.

            <li>
              Store all derived data in a lightweight, offline database (for example, SQLite) to
              make updates and queries faster as the dataset grows.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrate journal- and venue-ranking information so publications can be filtered and
              summarized by journal quality tiers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide richer analysis views that let users define custom criteria (programs, years,
              topics, institutions, journal ranks) and generate tailored summary charts and tables.
